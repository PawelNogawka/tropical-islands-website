Github pages link: https://github.com/PawelNogawka/tropical-islands-website/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages

When I created this website I learned how to create:

- Animated h1 on the start page
- A slider on the start page that uses the position and opacity properties
- Animated search input
- Slider using flex and transform properties
- A counter that activates when the website visitor is close to the section where the counter is located.
- 3d cards that rotate 180 degrees when the user hovers over them with the mouse - I used the transform and opacity properties here.
- Photo galleries using flex, flex-grow properties
- Countdown
- Footer using the grid property
- Some interesting animations related to buttons and links
- I learned how to implement a vector that I downloaded from the figma application and how to make it responsive

I used technologies such as:
- HTML, CSS, JS, SCSS, GULP, BEM.
